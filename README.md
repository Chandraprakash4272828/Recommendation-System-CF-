# 🎯 Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Recommendation System** using **Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization (SVD)**.  
The model predicts user preferences based on past ratings and recommends items accordingly.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering
- Apply matrix factorization (SVD)
- Predict unseen user–item ratings
- Evaluate performance using RMSE and MAE

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Surprise

---

## 📊 Dataset
A sample user–item ratings dataset is used with the following columns:
- `user_id`
- `item_id`
- `rating`

---

## 🧠 Model Used
- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**
- Learns latent user and item features
- Predicts ratings for unseen interactions

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Lower values indicate better prediction accuracy.
